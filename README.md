# Building a data pipeline

In this project, a data pipeline class that schedules the tasks in the correct order is constructed in Python from scratch. This class will be built around a __directed acyclic graph (DAG)__ as the scheduler for it. Instead of a linear ordering, this graph give us the ability to create multiple branches of dependencies.
